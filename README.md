IoT Final Project - Car Detection

## Environment Setup Requirements

### Installation
Make sure that you have downloaded either the 2017 or 2018 version of Matlab.  You should also make sure that you have the Computer Vison and Neural Network toolboxes installed in your library.  

### renameImages.m
Line 5: Rename project directtory to the directory that contains the dataset of 100 images  
Line 11: Save files to which ever directory you want to save the renamed images to.

### InputPreprocessing.m
Line 16: Change the directory to the directory which contains your renamed images.  This should be the same directory as the one you created in renameImages.m.  Keep the last part "%d.jpg" because this will get the exact filepath for the images.

### CarDetect.m
No changes need to be made to the matlab code.
